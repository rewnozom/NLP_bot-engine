## Part 2: NLP Bot-Engine

### Overview
The **NLP Bot-Engine** is a Python-based application that combines a PySide6-based graphical interface with advanced NLP capabilities. It is designed to answer complex product-related queries by using techniques such as intent analysis, entity extraction, context management, and semantic matching. The bot integrates product data (from indices and extraction outputs) to provide detailed, formatted responses in a chat interface.

### Architecture

#### GUI & Application Core (`main.py`)
- Sets up the main window and UI panels: **Chat Interface**, **Product Explorer**, **JSON Editor**, **Settings Panel**, and **Report Viewer**.
- Applies themes and font settings via helper modules and handles user interactions.

#### Core Modules (under `nlp_bot_engine/core`)
- **Engine (`engine.py`):**  
  - **AdvancedBotEngine** acts as the central orchestrator. It differentiates between direct command queries (using prefixes like `-t`, `-c`, etc.) and natural language queries.
  - Updates statistics, caches responses, and delegates to the Data Manager and Response Generator.
- **Data Manager (`data_manager.py`):**  
  - Manages access to integrated product data and indices (technical specs, compatibility, summaries, product names).
  - Provides search functionality and builds/updates product name mappings.
- **Configuration (`config.py`):**  
  - Centralizes configuration settings (directory paths, NLP settings, response templates, caching, performance parameters).
  - Automatically sets up required directories and adjusts paths based on the runtime environment.

#### Dialog Modules (under `nlp_bot_engine/dialog`)
- **Response Generator (`response_generator.py`):**  
  - Formats dynamic responses based on query analysis using a collection of templates.
  - Adjusts response detail according to inferred user expertise.
- **Templates (`templates.py`):**  
  - Contains a collection of predefined response templates for various scenarios (technical, compatibility, summary, clarification, errors).

#### NLP Modules (under `nlp_bot_engine/nlp`)
- **Processor (`processor.py`):**  
  - Serves as the main NLP interface. Handles text preprocessing, tokenization, and generates embeddings using transformer models.
- **Entity Extractor (`entity_extractor.py`):**  
  - Extracts entities (product identifiers, dimensions, etc.) using spaCyâ€™s NER, regex-based methods, and product index matching.
  - Merges overlapping entities and enriches them with additional product data.
- **Intent Analyzer (`intent_analyzer.py`):**  
  - Combines keyword-based, semantic, entity-based, and context-based approaches to identify user intent.
  - Outputs a ranked list of intents along with confidence scores.
- **Context Manager (`context_manager.py`):**  
  - Maintains conversation context by tracking query history, resolving pronoun references, and updating the active product based on previous interactions.

### Dependencies & Setup

#### Required Packages
- **Python 3.x**
- **PySide6:** For GUI components  
  `pip install PySide6`
- **spaCy:** For NLP processing  
  `pip install spacy` and download the model: `python -m spacy download sv_core_news_lg`
- **Transformers:** For embeddings and semantic analysis  
  `pip install transformers`
- **Numpy:** For numerical operations  
  `pip install numpy`
- **Standard Libraries:** logging, re, json, datetime, etc.

#### Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   Ensure all modules (GUI, core, dialog, NLP) are arranged according to the repository structure.
2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   pip install PySide6 spacy transformers numpy
   ```
   Download the required spaCy model:
   ```bash
   python -m spacy download sv_core_news_lg
   ```
3. **Configuration:**  
   Modify default paths, NLP settings, and response templates in `nlp_bot_engine/core/config.py` or supply a custom configuration dictionary.

### Usage

- **Launching the Application:**  
  Run the main entry point:
  ```bash
  python main.py
  ```
  This opens the Developer Bot-Chat window with three panels:
  - Left Panel: **Product Explorer** and **Settings Panel**
  - Right Panel: **Chat Interface** and **JSON Editor**
  - Additional Panel: **Report Viewer**

- **Interacting with the Bot:**  
  - **Direct Commands:** Use command prefixes (`-t`, `-c`, `-s`, `-f`) with a product ID (and optional parameters) to retrieve technical, compatibility, summary, or full product information.
  - **Natural Language Queries:** Type your question directly. The engine preprocesses the text, extracts entities, determines intent, and updates conversation context before generating a formatted response.

### Module Responsibilities

#### Application Core (`main.py`)
- Initializes the GUI, connects signals between panels, loads/saves configuration, and routes user selections to the appropriate modules.

#### Engine (`engine.py`)
- **AdvancedBotEngine:**  
  Orchestrates query processing by distinguishing command versus natural language inputs, updating statistics, caching responses, and delegating data retrieval and response formatting.

#### Data Management (`data_manager.py`)
- Loads product indices (article numbers, EAN codes, compatibility maps, etc.) and manages product data retrieval (technical specs, summaries, compatibility).
- Builds and updates product name mappings.

#### Configuration (`config.py`)
- Sets default directories (integrated data, cache, products), defines NLP settings (spaCy model, embeddings model, confidence thresholds), and response templates.

#### Response Generation (`response_generator.py` & `templates.py`)
- Formats responses for both command-based and natural language queries.
- Adjusts the level of detail based on inferred user expertise.

#### NLP Components
- **Processor (`processor.py`):**  
  Handles text preprocessing, tokenization, and loads spaCy and transformer models for embeddings.
- **Entity Extractor (`entity_extractor.py`):**  
  Extracts entities via spaCy NER, regex, and product index matching. Merges overlapping entities and enriches them.
- **Intent Analyzer (`intent_analyzer.py`):**  
  Combines multiple approaches (keywords, semantics, entities, context) to identify the userâ€™s intent.
- **Context Manager (`context_manager.py`):**  
  Tracks conversation history, active products, and resolves ambiguous references in user queries.

### Workflow

1. **User Input Handling:**  
   The AdvancedBotEngine receives input from the chat interface.
2. **Command vs. Natural Language:**  
   Direct commands (prefixed with `-`) are processed immediately, while natural language queries are passed through NLP processing (preprocessing, entity extraction, intent analysis, context update).
3. **Response Generation:**  
   The Response Generator formats the answer using appropriate templates and returns a structured response.
4. **Display:**  
   The formatted response is displayed in the chat window, and related data may be updated in the JSON Editor or Report Viewer.

### Developer Tips & Future Enhancements

- **Extending Functionality:**  
  - To add new response templates, update `templates.py` and adjust logic in the Response Generator.
  - Enhance entity extraction by refining regex patterns or spaCy custom components.
  - Improve intent detection by adjusting weightings or expanding the list of intent prototypes.
- **Configuration Adjustments:**  
  - Update default paths, caching settings, and performance parameters in `config.py` as needed.
  - Use the Settings Panel to modify configuration at runtime.
- **Testing & Logging:**  
  - Leverage logging (to file and console) for troubleshooting.
  - Develop unit tests for core modules (Data Manager, Entity Extractor, Intent Analyzer).
- **Performance & Learning:**  
  - Monitor cache usage and adjust `max_workers` and cache TTL.
  - Consider integrating learning mechanisms using user feedback to refine intent detection and response quality.
